TIme WArner tries to help you take your hourly computer screen break.
It pops up in the middle of your screen, informing you to get your well deserved eye rest.

=== Usage
TiWa is mostly self-explanatory but for:
* Shift + Click on the Start Button to start the timer and minimize it at the same time
* To change the default 50 minute timer simply change the value in settings.txt

=== Technical
* WPF 4.0
* Directly includes and uses some of my "Atom" library
